# AWS-Spot-Instances-Dataset-Analysis-using-Hadoop-MapReduce-Hive-BigQuery
Data is completely analysed using Hadoop ecosystem. In general, AWS Spot Instances are way cheaper than the AWS On-Demand Instances. So here, we determine the region/Availability Zone which is most stable and has the lowest instance price, i.e. with less number of fluctuations in the AWS pricing, users can worry less about the instances terminating without any prior notice.
